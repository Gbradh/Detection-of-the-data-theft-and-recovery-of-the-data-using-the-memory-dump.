# Detection-of-the-data-theft-and-recovery-of-the-data-using-the-memory-dump.

## Problem Statements 

Here we have received a memory dump of a subject’s computer which was infected by a 
Ransomware malware and certain traces of it were left behind. The subject had a crucial file 
which he had encrypted and stored in his computer which was affected by the attacker and he 
needs to recover the data file. Using certain forensics techniques, we need to identify the 
source code of the malware and to recover the data lost in the attack, especially the important 
encrypted file. 

## Learning Objective: 
1. Learning to analyse memory dump data and evidence: Here we will be 
analysing 3 pieces of evidence and we will be able to learn about which pieces 
of data need to be analysed. 

2. Identifying Indicators of Data Theft: We’ll be learning to identify signs of data 
theft and lost data. We’ll be understanding common patterns of data theft. 

3. Recovering Compromised Data: We’ll be learning to recover lost data using 
common industry tools and techniques.
